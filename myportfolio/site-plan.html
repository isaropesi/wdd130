      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I have knowledge in HTML and CSS; Web technology, Web design and development.
        I'm working on two college projects that consist of two websites: one for a fictional rafting company and the other is my personal website that I chose as my portfolio. The purpose of these projects is to participate in Web design, programming and development, and thus to understand them.

        My Personal Website Proposal consists in a portfolio website to show future employers. This portfolio will help me illustrate my skills and show evidence of the experience I have acquired throughout my career. In addition, it is a unique way to showcase my work and let others know about myself. It's like an evergreen platform for my projects, case studies, and information about me. Also, it will highlight my personality, experience, and capabilities, by profiling my goals, progress, achievements and competencies in an organised, accessible and purposeful format, without overwhelming prospective employers.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Dicovering my way.
        I finished high school in 2020 and took the High School National Exam (ENEM) in 2021 with a performance of 980/1000 in the essay. In January/2021 I entered the job market as an Administrative Apprentice in the Finance department of a multinational company working in financial purchase and sale processes, documentation, customer service within identifying and solving problems. In addition, as an apprentice, the company SESCOOP taught modules of the Administrative Assistant program with a focus on professional posture, financial management and MS Office. I recently began my studies in the field of Technology at Brigham Young University. Learning more every day, I am interested in working in the area from now on.
        I have knowledge in HTML and CSS; Web technology, Web design and development.
